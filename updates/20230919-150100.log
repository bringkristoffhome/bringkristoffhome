Baby Kristoff status: current antibiotic Pip-taz is no longer effective so he will be given Meropenem a much stronger antibiotic which is why he will be referred to an infection control specialist doctor. He was taken off the mechanical vent to wean off and he lasted a few hours but needed to be attached to the vent again. He is doing his best and his vital signs are stable. We are still waiting for the cardiologist to come so 2d echo can be performed and he can be checked for his heart. Please pray so he can fight of his current infection which is the main problem he currently is facing now.
